	<h2 align="center">2018 Team Previews</h2>
	
	<h3>Crooked Commish</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> No. 1 Seed in Playoffs, Lost in Championship Game</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Antonio Brown, Gronk, Alvin Kamara</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> With Matthew Stafford and Andy Dalton as his top 2 QBs, the Commish would do well to take a shot at one of the Top 5 Rookie QB Prospects</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong>The league commissioner for over a decade now, Zweerink has been steadfast value running the league, but his on the field results have historically been lacking.  That all changed with advent of the Dynasty League in 2017, when a fabulous draft led to an appearance in the championship.  Expect Zweerink's team to remain in the league's upper echelon for years to come.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong> With Mark Ingram suspended for the first 4 games of the season, look for this squad to start strong riding Alvin Kamara to the end zone, and stay strong via the hands of Antonio Brown and (a hopefully healthy) Gronkowski.  A return to the playoffs expected, a return to the championship very realistic.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Electricity Minute</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 11th in standings, 3-11</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Carson Wentz, Julio Jones</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> Running back, Running back, Running back. With Devonta Freeman as his only reliable backfield presence (and he himself in a time-share with Tevin Coleman), Rueckert needs a reliable second starter, not to mention depth for matchup situations, byes, and injuries.</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong> One of the Gang's most historically realiable owners. An devoted drafter of Drew Brees, Rueckert held off in '17 going into Dynasty mode without the 38 year-old.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong> Rueckert had a down year in 2017, due in large part to injuries. With a healthy Wentz back in '18, expect an upswing in wins.  However, depth at RB and TE could limit this team's cieling - a smart draft and a trade or due could serve this franchise well.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Frodell Beckham Jr</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 9-5, missing out on playoffs due only to 14 VPs compared to the 8-6 Thorp squad, who had 15.</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Tom Brady, Adam Thielen</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> With the ageless wonder Tom Terrific on the wrong side of 40 now, when will we start to see a decrease in play?  Drafting a Josh Allen/Sam Rosen type would not be unwise for 2020 and beyond.</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong> The newest member of the Blue Fish Gang, joining in 2014, Fro was in the lower half of the league standing for the first couple years. However, he hit his stride in '17, just missing out on the playoffs.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong> If Kirk Cousins can pick up where Case Keenum left off last year in Minnesota, Fro will benefit with another big year from both Thielen and Kyle Rudolph.  RB depth is a concern, as it is for many fantasy franchises.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Great Plumbers</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 7-7, the other painful playoff miss from 2017.  15 VPs tied him with Thorp, who got in with the better record.</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Odell Beckham Jr., Cam Newton</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong>Outside of Jay Ajayi, RB is the RB outlook is unstable for Schneider.  Draft one in the first round, and throw a dart at another in the second</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong>With up and down finishes throughout the years, Schneider is the most active on the trade block in the league.  This means a high varience of outcomes for the Plumbers, from basement-dweller (2016) to champion (2007).</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong>With a draft to solidify RB depth, and with a healthy Jordan Reed in DC, his .500 record could easily improve.</li>
		</ul>
			
	<h3>Harvey Mule's Left Handed Cigarettes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 2-12, Last in standings</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> David Johnson</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> Alshon Jeffery is a solid WR, and if Corey Davis builds upon a strong end to his rookie year he could be a Top-10 performer.  A third option could be acquired through the draft.</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile</strong> Don't let the 2-12 record fool you - Woody has fielded strong teams in the past.  After the devastating loss of the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 dynasty draft in Johnson, one wonders if the Cigs could have done anymore to salvage the season.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook</strong> With the first overall pick for the second straight year, it is a lock for Harvey to take Saquon Barkley.  Paired with a healthy David Johnson, a last place could be followed by a playoff spot in '18.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>MooBangers</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 10-4, 3 Seed in playoffs</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Russell Wilson, Leonard Fournette, Michael Thomas, Travis Kelce
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> As one can see, the Cows have star players across the board.  Taking the best available player with the 10th overall pick could provide depth</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong> Ronk showed his prowess as a drafter at the perfect moment, hitting big in the initial dynasty draft.  Follow that up with a plyoff appearance, Ronk is riding high as an owner heading into this season</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong> The roster is set up for continued success for 2018 and beyond.  Look for the MooBangers to be a contended for the foreseeable future.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>North Korea National Team</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 7-7, 8th in standings</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Aaron Rodgers, Chris Thompson</li>
			<li></strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> Without a consistent workhorse back on the roster, the Koreans, who traded up for the 2nd overall pick in this year's draft, must take who they believe is the second best back off the boeard after Barkley.</li>
			<li></strong>Owner Profile:</strong> Annually at the end of draft night, Lyman has the right to feel confident in his team,  However, this is a franchise that has not once entered the playoffs.  Is bad injury luck or poor ownership to blame?  Likely a bit of both</li>
			<li></strong>Season Outlook:</strong> With a healthy A-Rod, the Nats should have the QB advantage on a weekly basis.  If Amari Cooper can return to his 2016 form, shedding the 2017 drops and relative irrelevance, this team could make some noise.  RB looks to be shaky though</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Rampant Ewoks</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 9-5, 2nd in standings with 20 VPs</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Zeke Elliot, Deshaun Watson, Keenan Allen</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> Like the MooBangers, the Ewoks have at least one stud across every position.  Find the best available and draft for depth.</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong> Before '17 Duckart had consistently found himself in the lower half of the standings.  That all changed with a fabulous dynasty draft last year.  Watson, Zeke, and Allen are three of the best young studs in the league.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong> After a runner-up finish in the standings last year, don't expect much of a drop off, granted his three stars stay on the field (there is a history of risk with all three).  If so, we have a championship contendeder.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Run The Table</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 6-8, 9th in standings</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Le'Veon Bell, Matt Ryan, Shady McCoy</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs</strong> While Kropp has his starting backfield weekly, his starting WRs are a question mark weekly.  Pick 3 is high to select the first WR, but it may be the route to go here.</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong> Kropp has been seen as one of the headier owners in the league.  After a WR misfire in the '17 draft, look for him to potentially trade and draft to improve this position.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook</strong> Bell on his own could make this team relavent.  After a down year in 2017, Matt Ryan's results could bare largely on whether Run The Table will imporove upon last year's record</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>The Sandbaggers</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 5-9, 10th in standings</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Kareem Hunt, Mike Evans, Andrew Luck</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> Hunt and Evans both could use a solid second starter to be paired with.  Given the Bagger's confidence Luck's return, another QB for depth could also help.  No dire needs, but many directions this team could go.</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong> Tilot is a former champion of the league, and though '17 was a down year, no one questions his abilities as an owner.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong> If Luck can return to form, look for the Sandbaggers to rack up high point totals on a weekly basis.  Playoffs would be realistic.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Thorp</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 Finish:</strong> 8-6, 4th seed in playoffs, <ins>League Champion</ins></li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> Todd Gurley, Davante Adams</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs:</strong> Alex Smith was an MVP candidate last year - at age 34 and with an inconsistant past, is decline on the way?  Mariotta is much younger, but still is questioned as a reliable fantasy (and overall) QB.  Future QB investment would be wise.</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile:</strong> Schewiener had never been perceived as one of the league's more intelligent owners by <del>most</del> all.  Then last year happened.  Has he made us believers?  We will see how he follows up in '18, but no one can deny that he is our reigning league champion.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong> Gurley should continue ot be a beast.  With Rodgers back in Green Bay, Adams could push to be the top receiver in fantasy.  These 2 alone may push Thorp back to the playoffs.  A bit of uncertainty surrounds the QB situation, while a lot of uncertainty surrounds the TEs.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Unspoiled Milq</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>2017 finish:</strong> 6-8, 7th in standings</li>
			<li><strong>Star Players:</strong> AJ Green, Drew Brees</li>
			<li><strong>2018 Draft Needs</strong> The cupboard is bare at RB.  The cupboard is old at QB.  Finding solid future performers at both positions would help keep Milq Unspoiled.</li>
			<li><strong>Owner Profile</strong> Dworak often has made questionable draft picks.  2017 was another example.  34 year-old Frank Gore led his team at RB last year, followed by Theo Riddick.  Given this, one might be impressed that the team finished as well as 6-8.</li>
			<li><strong>Season Outlook:</strong> Brees easily has another season or two of big points ready to be accumulated.  If Dez Bryant lands in a good situation (Is there a <em>good</em> situation for Dez Bryant?) he could pair with Green to once again make for an intimidating receiving corps.  Will an RB on this roster breakout for a big year?</li>
